# maestro 

A simple web app to streamline the music downloading flow I've had since like 2010. Search for any song on YouTube, collect as many as you'd like in your cart, and download them (checkout) in one click ! Built using the Go standard library + PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ on the backend, a Go file server + vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS on the frontend. Added some keybindings that can be viewed [here]()
